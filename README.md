**Bachelor of Engg - Electronics & Communication**, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, 2017

## Experience
**Data Science Intern, The University of Texas at Dallas (May 2023 - Current)**

In my role, I've been responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining visually engaging and interactive single-cell RNA web application dashboards using RShiny. These dashboards have allowed users to effectively interact with large and complex datasets, enhancing their data analysis capabilities. Additionally, I led the development and deployment of a centralized Sensoryomics web application, streamlining access to diverse datasets and implementing Git version control for efficient collaboration and management. Furthermore, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for internal budgets, empowering stakeholders to allocate grants efficiently and monitor expenditure. This initiative resulted in a notable 25% reduction in administrative time and significantly improved financial decision-making capabilities within the organization.


**Data Scientist II , Honeywell (June 2021 - July 2022)**

I collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements and design business requirement documents, implementing data-driven solutions that delivered valuable insights to leadership teams and integrated results into operational platforms. Utilizing the random forest algorithm in R, I developed a resource acquisition model resulting in a 30% reduction in hiring time and accurately forecasted terminations and vacancies for upcoming quarters with 70% accuracy. Additionally, I independently designed and implemented the Compensation Offer Tool, a statistical algorithm providing managers and hiring teams with valuable insights for talent acquisition and internal job changes through an RShiny dashboard user interface. Moreover, I developed KPI metrics to evaluate program effectiveness using descriptive statistics and automated the end-to-end process using Alteryx ETL tool and R programming, resulting in saving nearly 400 hours annually.

 
**Data Scientist I , Honeywell (Aug 2019 - May 2021)**

I spearheaded efforts to streamline processes, saving nearly 600 hours annually through automation using R and the Alteryx tool. Additionally, I collaborated on building a real-time predictive model for employee churn prediction, resulting in significant cost savings of almost $10 million annually by enabling HR and leadership teams to prevent turnover through actionable insights. Moreover, I played a pivotal role in the migration of data from local SSMS to Hadoop in the Domino system and facilitated the migration of projects to the cloud. I also took charge of designing and presenting communication analytics dashboards to executive teams using Tableau, offering insights crucial for informed decision-making. Furthermore, I leveraged Python to implement NLP models for sentiment analysis and topic extraction on communications and survey data. Lastly, I contributed to the development of technical documentation for tools and SOPs for projects and provided training to over 5 new team members, proactively delivering accurate data analysis results to business leaders and customers, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.


**Programer Analyst, Cognizant (Mar 2018 - August 2019)**

I developed and implemented a smart auditing process using machine learning techniques across various marketing regions, leading to a notable 15% increase in transaction error capture and saving 3.7 FTE. Additionally, I enhanced the invoice processing methodology by optimizing transaction delivery through a prioritization algorithm, resulting in a 10% improvement. Furthermore, I designed and implemented operational and ad-hoc reporting dashboards utilizing R Shiny, Power BI, and Excel to track audit and invoice processes efficiently. Moreover, I collaborated closely with internal stakeholders to develop and maintain automation solutions using R, which significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of analytical reports, contributing to enhanced operational performance.
